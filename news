                          CORFU.EL - CHANGELOG
                         ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


1 Version 2.8 (2026-01-18)
══════════════════════════

  • Auto completion code factored out to `corfu-auto.el'.
  • Overall code simplifications.
  • Optimized completion of non-exclusive Capfs.
  • Use `when-let*' instead of `when-let'.


2 Version 2.7 (2025-12-28)
══════════════════════════

  • `corfu-popupinfo-hide': Change default to nil.
  • `corfu-popupinfo-delay': Reduce delay when changing candidates to
    0.5.
  • `corfu-popupinfo-margin-width': New customization variable.
  • `corfu-border-width': New customization variable.
  • `corfu-popupinfo': Faster scrolling speed.
  • `corfu-popupinfo': Fix Emacs 30 deprecation warning.
  • Fix Corfu popup position at the right edge of the parent frame.
  • Work around Emacs bug#79792, where the `*Help*' buffer is replaced
    unexpectedly.
  • Use new function `set-frame-size-and-position-pixelwise' on Emacs
    31.


3 Version 2.6 (2025-12-07)
══════════════════════════

  • Bugfixes.
  • Add name to Corfu child frame to improve readability of
    `(frame-list)'.
  • TTY: Fix child frame misalignment due to internal border.
  • TTY: Hide frame immediately.
  • TTY: Adjust default faces for low-color terminals.


4 Version 2.5 (2025-11-15)
══════════════════════════

  • `corfu-auto-trigger': New customization variable to trigger
    immediate completion after certain characters. See also
    `cape-capf-trigger'.
  • `corfu-on-exact-match': Change default from `insert' to `nil', which
    is more compatible with auto completion and
    template/snippet/abbreviation expansion.
  • Improve compatibility with Eglot. Fix a manual completion bug in the
    case when Eglot provided no matching candidates.
  • Experimental: Use new function `set-frame-position-and-size' if
    available.


5 Version 2.4 (2025-10-13)
══════════════════════════

  • Require Emacs 29.1.
  • Handle mixed tty/graphical displays.
  • Do not enable Corfu in read-only buffers.


6 Version 2.3 (2025-06-12)
══════════════════════════

  • Minor corrections and fixes.


7 Version 2.2 (2025-05-26)
══════════════════════════

  • Guard Corfu hooks to automatically print stack traces in order to
    ease debugging.


8 Version 2.1 (2025-04-22)
══════════════════════════

  • `corfu-history-duplicate' and `corfu-history-decay': New
    customization options to adjust the rank of duplicate history
    elements, such that they appear earlier in the completion list.
  • `corfu-history-mode': Add `corfu-history' to
    `savehist-minibuffer-history-variables' in order to save the history
    if `savehist-mode' is enabled.


9 Version 2.0 (2025-03-28)
══════════════════════════

  • `corfu-quick': Ensure that popup does not move.


10 Version 1.7 (2025-01-28)
═══════════════════════════

  • Bugfixes only.


11 Version 1.6 (2024-12-22)
═══════════════════════════

  • Require Emacs 28.1.
  • Use fringe to display scroll bar. This change improves performance
    and makes sure that the scroll bar cannot be pushed outside the
    child frame by the content. This affects for example `cape-emoji'.
  • Improve suffix alignment.
  • Remember popup width during completion to avoid width
    fluctuations. Basically the popup is only allowed to grow.
  • `corfu-insert-separator': Jump back to prompt if a candidate is
    previewed.


12 Version 1.5 (2024-07-26)
═══════════════════════════

  • New customization variable `global-corfu-minibuffer' to enable Corfu
    in the minibuffer.
  • Unbind `C-a' in `corfu-map'. This binding is only needed in modes
    which override `C-a' instead of remapping `move-beginning-of-line'.
  • Unbind `<tab>' in `corfu-map'. This binding is only needed in modes
    which bind `<tab>' instead of `TAB', as was the case in old versions
    of Org. If you use such a mode, please report this as a bug for this
    mode. In the meantime you can use `(keymap-set corfu-map "<tab>"
    #'corfu-complete)'.
  • Add new command `corfu-send' as alternative to `corfu-insert'.
  • `corfu-popupinfo': Support both `face' and `font-lock-face'
    highlighting.
  • Bump Compat dependency to Compat 30.


13 Version 1.4 (2024-05-23)
═══════════════════════════

  • `corfu-auto-commands': Add `delete-backward-char'.


14 Version 1.3 (2024-04-05)
═══════════════════════════

  • Preserve currently selected candidate on further input. This matters
    if candidate preview is disabled (`corfu-preview-current=nil').
  • Add new command `corfu-expand' bound to `M-TAB' by default. The
    command expands the input via `completion-try-completion', for
    example the `basic' completion
  …  …
